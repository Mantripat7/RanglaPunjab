                <p class=" fst-italic">
                Jalandhar is one of the oldest cities in the Punjab region and has a very rich history. Jalandhar, which was formerly known as Jullundhar has many eminent heritage sites which stand testimony to the rich history of this ancient city. This city of great antiquity prides itself on being the city of many historical edifices opens up a treasure trove of tourist delight and attracts plenty of tourists throughout the year.
                According to the Padma Purana, the city takes its name from the demon King, Jalandhra, who was the son of the Ocean.  According to another legend, Jalandhar was the capital of the kingdom of Raja Lav, son of Lord Rama. Another version says that Jalandhar is said to have derived its name from the vernacular term `Jalandhar’ means area inside the water, i.e. tract lying between the two rivers Satluj and Beas. Yet another name of Jalandhar had been Trigartta, as it was waters by three rivers, Satlej, Beas and Ravi.
                In ancient era, Jalandhar and the entire region of Punjab was an essential part of the Indus Valley Civilization. The archaeological exploration carried on in recent years has pushed the antiquity of the district of Jalandhar of the Harappa period.
                During the Kanishka rule who was the Kushan King of northern India, Jalandhar played the host for the great conference of Buddhists theorists in about 100 AD to collect and arrange the sacred writings of Buddhism and also to bring about reconciliation between its various sects. So this makes Jalandhar along with Multan the oldest surviving city of the entire Punjab region.
                In 7th century, during the rule of King Harsha Vardhana a famous Chinese traveller by the name of Hiuen Tsang visited India, and during this period kingdom of Jalandhar was under Raja Utito. The Rajput Rajas appear to have continued to rule over the country right up to the 12th century. According to the Chinese pilgrim Fa Hien, who travelled India between 399 and 411 C.E., there were large numbers of Buddhist Viharas in India. From the latter half of the tenth century up to AD 1019, the district of Jalandhar was included in the Shahi Kingdom of the Punjab and Jalandhar city was an important city in the region.
